# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to document and analyze the requirements of a software project. Its purpose is to clearly identify what the system should do, capture user needs, and provide a structured foundation for design and development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis involves communicating with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to understand what they expect from the system. The process includes:

1-Elicitation: Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, brainstorming, or workshops.

2-Analysis & Specification: Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, and clarity, then documenting them (e.g., Software Requirement Specification – SRS).

3-Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with user needs.

4-Management: Handling changes in requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is important because it:

1-Defines the project scope – clarifies what should be built and what not.

2-Prevents misunderstandings – ensures developers and stakeholders share the same vision.

3-Reduces cost and time – catching issues early avoids expensive rework later.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
1. Requirement Gathering

Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders, users, and clients through discussions, surveys, observations, or questionnaires. This step helps capture initial expectations of the system.

2. Requirement Elicitation

Engaging stakeholders through interviews, workshops, brainstorming sessions, or use-case analysis to deeply understand their needs. The goal is to uncover both explicit and hidden requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation

Organizing and recording the gathered requirements in a structured format such as a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. This ensures clarity and acts as a reference throughout the project.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Evaluating the collected requirements for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and prioritization. Often involves creating models (like data flow diagrams or use-case diagrams) to better visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation

Verifying that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs. This may involve reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to ensure alignment before moving to design and development.

# Types of Requirements

1. Functional Requirements
Define what the system should do.
Examples (Booking Management Project):
Create, update, and cancel bookings.
Send booking confirmation emails.

2. Non-functional Requirements
Define how the system should perform.
Examples (Booking Management Project):
Confirm bookings in under 3 seconds.
Ensure secure authentication & encryption.

#Use Case Diagrams 
A Use Case Diagram shows how users (actors) interact with the system. It helps visualize functionality, user roles, and improves communication in design.

Booking System Actors & Use Cases:
User: Create, update, cancel, view booking.
Admin: Manage bookings, generate reports.
System: Send confirmation, process payments.
