# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to document and analyze the requirements of a software project. Its purpose is to clearly identify what the system should do, capture user needs, and provide a structured foundation for design and development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis involves communicating with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to understand what they expect from the system. The process includes:

1-Elicitation: Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, brainstorming, or workshops.

2-Analysis & Specification: Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, and clarity, then documenting them (e.g., Software Requirement Specification â€“ SRS).

3-Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with user needs.

4-Management: Handling changes in requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
